Production rules:
    - id: predecessor : cond -> successor : prob

Scope rules:
    - T(x,y,z): Translation of vector (x,y,z) to the scope position
    - Rx(alpha), Ry(alpha), Rz(alpha): Rotation of angle alpha to the scope coordinate system
    - S(x,y,z): Set the size of the scope
    - [/]: Push/pop the current scope into the stack
    - I(objId): Add an instance of the primitive with identifier objId to the current scope (cube, quad, cylinder, etc.)

Split rule:
